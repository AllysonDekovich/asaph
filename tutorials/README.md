# Asaph
The [Asaph](https://github.com/rnowling/asaph) software implements methods for analyzing large inversions using SNP data.  Asaph and its methods have been described in our 2018 ACM-BCB paper [Detecting Chromosomal Inversions from Dense SNPs by Combining PCA and Association Tests](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3233571) and 2020 PLOS ONE paper [Detecting inversions with PCA in the presence of population structure](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240429).
